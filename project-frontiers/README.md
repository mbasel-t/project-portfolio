# Project Frontiers
Pieces of code within this folder are part of a personal project I started towards the end of COMP271 "Data Structures I", which I took in Summer 2024. The end goal for this project is a complete turn-based combat game, but, since this will take a very long time, I'm putting my favorite files from its very early state in here.

## Priority Bracket
This is a custom data structure built on top of the ArrayList from the Java Collections Framework. When engaging in combat in Frontiers, everyone chooses their action for their turn at the same time, but the order of action execution is determined by the priority level of the action and the speed stat of the action user. PriorityBracket.java sorts this out and outputs the information of these actions in order. There are a lot more details in the actual README for this file, including a method-by-method breakdown.
